# MaAS on CyberBench

This repo contains my assignment for running MaAS on a new benchmark suite (CyberBench).

- `week10.py`: end-to-end Colab script that:
  - Clones MaAS and CyberBench
  - Builds `data/cyberbench.csv`
  - Maps CyberBench rows into a `BenchmarkExample` format
  - Adapts them into MaAS queries
  - Runs a single-query wrapper and logs results
- `cyberbench_maas_logs/results.jsonl`: JSONL log of per-example MaAS results.
- `cyberbench_maas_logs/focus_cases.json`: JSON with the 5 easiest failures and 5 hardest successes.
- `maas_cyberbench_report.md`: deep-dive analysis of those 10 focus cases, including architectures and root-cause discussion.

Note: due to limitations in the public MaAS repo’s single-query API, the script uses a documented stub for the architecture and answer when necessary, and this is noted in the logs and report.
